# Spatial Domain

*Gaussian Bluring:*  Applying a Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the Image’s high- frequency component

*Median Filter:*  Non-linear digital filtering technique used for removing noise from an image or signal. It is done by sliding a window over the image. The filtered image is obtained by placing the median of the values in the input window, at the location of the center of that window, at the
output image.


*Image Sharpening:* It highlights edges and fine details in the image. This becomes	an effective high pass filter.

*Roberts Filter:* This filter highlights the edges of objects present in the image.

*Gamma Transform:* It controls the overall brightness of an image. Varying the amount of γ (Gamma) correction changes not only the brightness/ enhancement of the image but also the ratios	from red to green to blue.

*Log transform:* It replaces all pixel values, present in the image, with its logarithmic values. Log transformation is used for image enhancement as it expands dark pixels of the image as compared to higher
pixel values.

# Frequency Domain 

*Low Pass Filter:* The image is smoothed by decreasing the disparity between pixel values by averaging nearby pixels. Using a low pass filter tends to retain the low-frequency information within an image while reducing the high-frequency information.

*High Pass Filter:* It tends to retain the high-frequency information within an image while reducing the low-frequency information. The kernel of the high pass filter is designed to increase the brightness of the center pixel relative to neighboring pixels
